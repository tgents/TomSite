		<h3>About</h3>
		<p id="about">
		  Originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, I came up to Seattle to attend the University of Washington. I am now majoring Informatics, which focuses on teaching students about creating and organizing information systems with a focus on user experience and feedback. To accomplish this, Informatics students take courses on Design and User Research so that we can design for the user. In my case, I have found myself applying this to software development. I am more focused on the Software design and planning side and being able to effectively acquire user input for the things I make has been invaluable for creating easy to use applications and has been just a great learning experience overall for making applications. Now in my third year, I have learned so much from my various courses in Informatics and at the UW.
